{"name":"Graphics asst5","tagline":"Proposal for Graphics assignment 5.","body":"###Name \r\n   Sophia Zhu\r\n\r\n###Description\r\n   I have chosen Option B: Cartoon Interpolation as my project. I will attempt to implement the continuous deformation of cartoons/animations using the polygon method, and attempt to extend this to potentially manipulate images that are not strictly SVG files. An example of what I hope to achieve can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgs2Ew78Qfg), which achieves some of its animated effects by warping and deforming a drawn image in a way presumably similar to what has been described. \r\n\r\n###Concrete Steps\r\n1. Modify the project to be able to open/render non-SVG files along with an SVG file to sit on top of it and act as the frame/skeleton.\r\n2. Implement method to subdivide given polygon into triangles.\r\n3. Linearly interpolate these triangles in order to manipulate the image below.\r\n4. If time allows, implement methods for point and skeleton based manipulation, as mentioned here [here](http://igl.ethz.ch/projects/bbw/).  \r\n5. Record a video of the finished product in action.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
